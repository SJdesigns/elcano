elcano Explorer v3.2.5
--------------------------------------------------------------

To start using elcano first you need to add the users allowed to access it.
For that purpose you need to edit the explorer.php file adding one user by line.

Each user line MUST have the format shown below:

		'user' => 'password',

DON'T FORGET THE COMMA AT THE END

You only need the explorer.php file to use the app
The files folder contains the development code in different files while the explorer.php contains everthing in one file.
